# Markup Practice Repository

Here I do some html markup practice - transform design mockups to an actual wep page

## Notes

I plan to publish this as a github page and do completely different layout projects, so all URL's should be relative.

## Set-up live-server

- `npm install live-server`
- `live-server --mount=/common:common --port=3000 [PATH]`
	- `--mount=/common:common` to mount common files to `/common` route
	- `[PATH]` to the site root dir (dir with `index.html` file)
